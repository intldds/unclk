# Session 1 Exercise Solutions

## Chapter 1 - The Context of Cryptography

- **1.10.** Describe a concrete example where improving the security of a system against one type of attack can increase the likelihood of other attacks.

>**Answer:**
>
> While walls can provide a physical barrier against certain types of attacks, they can also create a false sense of security that can make a house more vulnerable to 
other types of attacks. For instance, if a house has walls, the occupants may feel more secure and be less vigilant about locking doors and windows or taking other security measures. This can make the house more vulnerable to attacks that do not require physical force, such as social engineering attacks or attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in the house's electronic systems. Additionally, walls can provide attackers with cover and concealment, making it easier for them to approach the house undetected and launch other types of attacks.

## Chapter 2 - Introduction to Cryptography

- **Q3.** Consider a group of 30 people who wish to establish pair-wise secure communications using symmetric-key cryptography. How many keys need to be exchanged in total?



- **Q4.** Suppose Bob receives a messages signed using a digital signature scheme with Alice's secret signing key. Does it prove that Alice saw the message and chose to sign.




- **Q6.** Suppose a chosen-ciphertext attacker cannot recover the secret decryption key for an encryption scheme. Does this mean the encryption scheme is secure?




- **Q7.** Consider a symmetric-key cryptosystem in which cryptographic keys are randomly selected from the set of all n-bit strings. Approximately what should n be in order to provide 128 bits of security against a birthday attack?
