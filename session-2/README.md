# Session 2 Exercise Solutions

## Chapter 3 - Block Ciphers

**Q1.** How much space would be required to store a table for an entire idealized block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks and has 80-bit keys?

>**Answer:**
>
> For an idealized block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks and has 80-bit keys, the size of the lookup table would be 2^(64) x 2^(80) = 2^(144) entries.
