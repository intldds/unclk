# Uncloak

Study group exercises for the Uncloak study group (Nov - March), with Thor and Chloe. On this 
README file I'll just write a short description of the **main topics** discussed in each session/week.


## Session 1 (Nov 18)

- Throughout the learning sessions, we'll cover the book "Cryptography Engineering" by Ferguson, Schneier and
Kohno;
- "Paranoia as a practical skill";
- Cryptography has grown a lot over the last 20 years. Even though it started out as the 
art and science of encryption, nowadays it is much broader, covering  concepts such as authentication, digital signatures, 
zero knowledge proving systems, FHE, MPC, iO and others;
- Chapters 1 and 2 provide an introduction to the field ("high-level overview").
